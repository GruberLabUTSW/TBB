Article Abstract
Talazoparib, a PARP inhibitor, is active in germline (g) BRCA1/2 mutant advanced HER2-negative breast cancer, but its activity beyond gBRCA1/2 is poorly understood. We conducted an investigator-initiated single institution open-label, non-randomized phase II trial with a 2-stage design to evaluate talazoparib in patients with pre-treated advanced HER2-negative breast cancer or other solid tumors with germline or somatic alterations in homologous recombination (HR) pathway genes, not including BRCA1/2. Patients received talazoparib 1 mg orally daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was objective response rate per RECIST 1.1. Twenty patients were enrolled in this cohort; 13 with breast and 7 non-breast cancer (pancreas, colon, uterine, testicular, parotid salivary). In patients with breast cancer, 4 had a RECIST partial response (ORR = 31%) and 3 additional patients had stable disease (SD) ï‚³6 months (clinical benefit rate; CBR = 54%). All patients with gPALB2 mutations had treatment-associated tumor regression. Tumor HR deficiency score was positively correlated with magnitude of treatment response and was elevated in all gPALB2 tumors. In addition, ctHRD, a novel metric of HR deficiency calculated from plasma whole exome sequencing, was also correlated with treatment outcome, as was a gPALB2-associated mutational signature. Thus, talazoparib demonstrated activity in HER2-negative advanced breast cancer patients with gPALB2 mutations, showing its activity in HR pathway gene mutations beyond germline BRCA1/2.
